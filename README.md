# openwrt-build-script

My little, personal build script for OpenWrt. I've written it to make updating my routers and access points easier and faster

If you want to use it, you're supposed to make several copies of this script - one for your every device. I've considered automatically building for several hotspots, but I want to keep this script as simple as possible
